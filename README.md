The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a global robotics competition that inspires students around the world.  Participants are challenged to demonstrate their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical abilities by designing and programming robots for various tasks.    

One exciting part of the WRO is the Future Engineers category.  Here, students must develop innovative robotic and automated solutions to real-world problems.  This category helps to cultivate future innovators by encouraging critical and creative thinking, which is essential for the next generation of engineers and technologists.    

This year, the Future Engineers category includes an interesting challenge: building a self-driving car.  This task requires participants to explore the latest advancements in robotics, adding complexity and innovation to the competition.
